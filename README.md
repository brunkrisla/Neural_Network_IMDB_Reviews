# Creating a Neural Network to classify IMDB Reviews as positive or Negative

The popularity in Artificial Intelligence has risen drastically in the past decade, with a particular focus on two specific concepts Machine Learning and Deep Learning. The popularity of Deep Learning in particular has increased due to the abundance of data and computational power, therefore allowing the development of more accurate models using vast amounts of data.

A key area of the application and use of Deep Learning involves Neural Networks. They are a set of algorithms loosely modeled on the human brain. They emulate how the interconnected cells function within the brain allowing them to be trained to learn and recognise patterns in a similar way to the human brain. More specifically Neural networks can be used for a variety of tasks, including; classification, clustering, and predictive regression analysis.

Typically a universal workflow is followed to ensure the machine-learning problem can be solved. 

Goal of this project was to build experience working with the tensorflow library and building deep learning models to solve a binary classification problem.In addition to this I wanted to get more experience in implemeting the universal machine learning workflow presented by Chollet (2021) in Deep Learning with Python. The workflow suggests building ML models by following 7 steps:

- Step 1 = Defining the problem and assembling a dataset
- Step 2 = Choosing a measure of success
- Step 3 = Deciding on an evalutation protocol
- Step 4 = Preparing your data 
- Step 5 = Developing a model that performs better than the baseline
- Step 6 = Scaling up --> developing a model that overfits
- Step 7 = Regularising the model and tuning hyperparamaters
